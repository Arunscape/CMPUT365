* Excercise 2.2
* Practice Question
\[v_\pi (s) = \sum_a \pi(a | s) \sum_{s', r} p(s', r| s, a) [r + \gamma v_\pi (s')]\]

pi a|s is 1/4

p(s', r | s, a) is 1 because it's deterministic MDP

so you just sum r + gamma v_pi s'

* MDP Worksheet
* Midterm
- lec5 page 31 is DEFINITELY on the midterm just with different numbers
- probably \#4 also
